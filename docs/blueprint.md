## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Forest Green (#388E3C), evokes growth, environment, and reliability, supporting a positive feeling about waste management.
- Background color: Off-White (#F2F2F2), same hue as the green, heavily desaturated for a clean look.
- Accent color: Slate Gray (#708090), provides a professional, subtle contrast against the green, while remaining neutral.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque sans-serif font known for a neutral and modern feel; excellent legibility
- Sidebar navigation icons should be simple line icons representing each section: Dashboard, Complaints, Workers, Leaderboard, Training, Facilities, Reports, Settings.
- Dashboard layout to follow a structure of sidebar navigation, top navigation bar, and card-based main content area for a modern UI/UX
- Subtle animations for state changes (e.g., button presses, loading screens) to improve perceived performance.
